These are syntax files for managing clearsilver templates (see http://clearsilver.net).  cs.vim will add formatting to <?cs ... ?> embedded in html syntax (it depends on runtime! syntax/html.vim).  hdf.vim is syntax highlighting for Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files.

cs.vim conflicts with the C# .cs extention.  So if you are also using vim to edit C# files you will have to... figure it out.
